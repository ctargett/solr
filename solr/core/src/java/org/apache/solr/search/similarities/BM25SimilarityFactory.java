/**
 * Factory for BM25Similarity. This is the default similarity since 8.x.
 *
 * <p>
 * Parameters:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>k1 (float): Controls non-linear term frequency normalization (saturation).
 *                   The default is <code>1.2</code>
 *   <li>b (float): Controls to what degree document length normalizes tf values.
 *                  The default is <code>0.75</code>
 *   <li>discountOverlaps (bool): True if overlap tokens (tokens with a position of increment of zero) are
 *                                discounted from the document's length.
 *                                The default is <code>true</code>
 * </ul>
 * @lucene.experimental
 * @since 8.0.0
